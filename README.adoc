/**
 * API for writing data into Hadoop according to HDFS block size
 *
 * ==Overview==
 * This includes
 *  - A method to write data into hive tables by producing the exact number of files expected (data volume divided by HDFS block size)
 *  - A faster method to write data into hive tables but it produces the approximate number of files expected
 *  - A method to write into HDFS directory by producing the exact number of files expected
 *
 *  This methods work also for a partitioned table
